# BLEConnect
Hello Everyone. My name is Sagar Tiwari and I am a ***Software Developer Engineer***.
This is my latest creation.
The codebase is missing some essential logic due to privacy concerns and copyright infringement.
I have created this BLECoonect app, that let's you connect to a BLE device (works on specific device only that is supplied by TIBE Innovations PVT. LTD. Company), and start reading stats thrown by that device.
It also has a feature that lets you download the monthly data collected by that BLE device.


## This is the Overview and steps to follow to use the main functionality of the app

### App Name: BLEConnect

#### Steps to follow to use the BLEConnect App:

# STEP 1: 
***Open the BLEConnect App. You will see this opening frame.***

# STEP 2: 
***After Clicking the scan button, the app will show you the nearby BLE devices. Select the device by clicking on the device name card. The BLE device name in most cases will be “=SHANTI-SOLAR-123”. The number is different for each device.***
