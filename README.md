Hello Everyone. My name is Sagar Tiwari and I am a ***Software Developer Engineer***.
This is my latest creation.
The codebase is missing some essential logic due to privacy concerns and copyright infringement.
I have created this BLECoonect app, that let's you connect to a BLE device (works on specific device only that is supplied by TIBE Innovations PVT. LTD. Company), and start reading stats thrown by that device.
It also has a feature that lets you download the monthly data collected by that BLE device.


# This is the Overview and steps to follow to use the main functionality of the app

## App Name: BLEConnect

### Steps to follow to use the BLEConnect App:

# STEP 1: Open the BLEConnect App. You will see this opening frame.
