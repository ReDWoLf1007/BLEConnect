Hello Everyone. My name is Sagar Tiwari and I am a Software Developer Engineer.
This is my latest creation.
The codebase is missing some essential logic due to privacy concerns and copyright infringement.
I have created this BLECoonect app, that let's you connect to a BLE device (works on specific device only that is supplied by TIBE Innovations PVT. LTD. Company), and start reading stats thrown by that device.
It also has a feature that lets you download the monthly data collected by that BLE device.
